# Cornix

![Cornix thumbnail](/docs/images/cornix_thumbnail.webp)

This document describes the ZMK configuration for the Cornix keyboard.

[CornixHub](https://cornixhub.com/): You can find keymaps, manual, default/stock firmware and guides.

Cornix is a 48 key column-staggered split keyboard built by [`Jezail Funder`](https://jezailfunder.jp/).

> [!Warning]
> Cornix stock firmware is RMK. It's completely fine to use stock firmware with Vial.
> However, to use Cornix with ZMK, you need to build your own custom firmware.
> This document will describe the usage for both methods below.

## Boards, Shields and Layout

### Boards

The project includes three main board definitions:

- **`cornix_left`**: The left half of the Cornix split keyboard, used when building firmware without a dongle configuration.
- **`cornix_right`**: The right half of the Cornix split keyboard, used for the slave side in split keyboard setup.

### Shields

The project includes several specialized shields that provide additional functionality:

- **`cornix_dongle_adapter`**: Provides common functionality for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality for dongle configurations. This shield is required when using the Cornix with a custom dongle.
- **`cornix_dongle`**: An example shield for setting up display device for the dongle board. This is used when the board doesn't already have `zephyr,display` in the device tree.
- **`cornix_indicator`**: A shield that enables RGB LED indicators for battery status and connection status. Note that using this shield consumes more power.

## Warning: device breakdown recovery

> [!Note]
> For instructions on flashing or resetting firmware, see the [#HOW TO USE/Advanced mode](#advanced-mode) section below.
> You may need to reset the firmware before flashing new firmware.

### Flashing/Resetting Default Firmware

The original Cornix firmware is available at [Original firmware](/docs/files/cornix_firmwareV1.11.zip).
Flash this firmware to the dongle to update/recover the Cornix keyboard.

### Bootloader Recovery

- The original RMK firmware removes the SoftDevice. So, before flashing new ZMK firmware, you need to restore the SoftDevice first.

#### Extracting SoftDevice (s140) for nRF52840

Download the bootloader for nRF52840 from:

- Official repository: <https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Bootloader>
- This bootloader is compatible with nRF52840-based keyboards using ZMK firmware

These commands extract the SoftDevice (s140) from the bootloader HEX file and convert it to UF2 format for flashing:

```bash
# Convert HEX to binary
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -I ihex -O binary pca10056_bootloader-0.2.11_s140_6.1.1.hex full_flash.bin

# Extract SoftDevice section
# Skip bootloader (4096 bytes, start address 0x1000)
# Count matches SoftDevice size (151016 bytes, end address: 0x25DE7 )
dd if=full_flash.bin of=s140_sd_only.bin bs=1 skip=4096 count=151016

# method 1: generate hex file,  flashing with nrfutil or nrf connect
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex -I binary s140_sd_only.bin s140_sd_only.hex
arm-none-eabi-objcopy --change-address 0x1000 s140_sd_only.hex  s140_sd_only.hex

# method 2: generate uf2 , flash by uf2 bootloader
# Convert bin content to UF2 format with start address for flashing
python3 uf2conv.py s140_sd_only.bin -f 0xada52840 -b 0x1000 -c -o s140_restore.uf2
```

nRF Connect for Desktop's Programmer is very useful for getting the SD address and size from the bootloader HEX file.

#### Extracting SoftDevice (s130) for nRF51

Command to extract SoftDevice (s130) section:

```bash
# Skip bootloader (4096 bytes)
dd if=full_flash.bin of=s132_sd_only.bin bs=1 skip=4096 count=155648
```

## How to Use

### Easy mode

> [!Note]
> Key remapping in wireless mode may fail due to signal interference. If connection fails, please retry or switch to wired mode. Key remapping works in both wired and wireless modes.

1. Connect the Cornix to the PC.
2. Open the key remapping website: [Vial](https://vial.rocks)
3. Click “Start Vial” in the center of the screen, then select “Cornix” (wired mode) or “Unknown Device (0000:0000)” (wireless mode) in the pop-up window at the top left.
4. After successful connection, enter the driver page to customize key functions

### Advanced mode

#### Reuse the config repo

4. Add Cornix shield

#### How to add Cornix shield

1. Modify west.yml
   - Edit the `config/west.yml` file, add to the `manifest/remotes` section:

   ```yaml
   remotes:
     - name: zmkfirmware
       url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
     - name: cornix-shield
       url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
     - name: urob
       url-base: https://github.com/urob
   ```

   - Add to the `manifest/projects` section:

   ```yaml
   projects:
     - name: zmk
       remote: zmkfirmware
       revision: main
       import: app/west.yml
     - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
       remote: cornix-shield
       revision: main
     - name: zmk-helpers
       remote: urob
       revision: main
   ```

2. Update Dependencies

   ```bash
   west update
   ```

3. Configure Build
   - Edit the `build.yaml` file, add:

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > 1. If you are using (default) cornix without dongle, choose "cornix_left", "cornix_right" and "reset".
   > 2. If you are using cornix with dongle, choose "cornix_dongle". "cornix_left_for_dongle", "cornix_right" and "reset".
   > 3. Add "cornix_indicator" shield to enable RGB led light. It consumes much more power, use at your own risk.

   ```yaml
   include:
     # Use cornix with dongle
     - board: nice_nano
       shield: cornix_dongle_adaptor cornix_dongle dongle_display
       snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
       artifact-name: cornix_dongle

     - board: cornix_ph_left
       # shield: cornix_indicator
       artifact-name: cornix_left_for_dongle

     # Use cornix without dongle
     - board: cornix_left
       # shield: cornix_indicator
       artifact-name: cornix_left

     - board: cornix_right
       # shield: cornix_indicator
       artifact-name: cornix_right

     - board: cornix_right
       shield: settings_reset
       artifact-name: reset
   ```

4. Build Firmware

   Use your preferred method to build
   - No need to recover the SD since 2.3.
   - Flash reset.uf2 to both sides of Cornix.
   - Flash left and right .uf2 files.
   - Reset both sides at the same time.

5. Flash Firmware

   Flash the generated `.uf2` files to the corresponding microcontroller:
   - Left half: `build/left/zephyr/zmk.uf2`
   - Right half: `build/right/zephyr/zmk.uf2`

#### Dongle Adapter Shield

For users who want to create their own custom dongle configurations, this repository provides a adapter shield. The complete configuration for the Cornix dongle can use multiple shields:

1. **`cornix_dongle_adapter`** - This is the common shield for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality
2. **`dongle_display`** - This is the display module for the dongle screen (or another display project)
3. **`cornix_dongle`** - This is an example shield for setting up display device for the board (if the board already has `zephyr,display` in the device tree, this display overlay shield is not needed)

The configuration in the `build.yaml` file shows how to use these shields for the dongle:

```yaml
include:
  # Use cornix with dongle
  - board: nice_nano
    shield: cornix_dongle_adapter cornix_dongle dongle_display
    snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
    artifact-name: cornix_dongle
```

To create a custom shield for the display part:

1. The `dongle_display` module is a module contains display widgets, included as part of the project dependencies via west or locally
2. If you need to create a custom shield for your display hardware, you can create a new shield that provides the appropriate display configuration. Here shows `cornix_dongle` as an example
3. If your board already has `zephyr,display` in the device tree, you can omit the `cornix_dongle` shield
4. Include your custom shield in the build configuration

For custom dongle screens, add a new target in build.yaml for your custom dongle:

```yaml
- board: nice_nano
  shield: cornix_dongle_adapter cornix_dongle dongle_display
  snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart zmk-usb-logging
  artifact-name: cornix_dongle
```

To create a custom shield for your display:

1. Use `cornix_dongle_adapter` as the base shield for the matrix and Bluetooth functionality
2. Add your custom shield in the `build.yaml` file with the appropriate board and configuration
3. Use `cornix_dongle` as an example and modify the display parts to match your custom board
4. You can copy the `cornix_dongle` into your project's `boards/shield/` directory, and use the same name or rename it as a new shield

The configuration in the `west.yml` file remains the same:

```yaml
remotes:
  - name: zmkfirmware
    url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
  - name: cornix-shield
    url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
  - name: urob
    url-base: https://github.com/urob
```

```yaml
projects:
  - name: zmk
    remote: zmkfirmware
    revision: main
    import: app/west.yml
  - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
    remote: cornix-shield
    revision: main
  - name: zmk-helpers
    remote: urob
    revision: main
```
