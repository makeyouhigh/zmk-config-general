# Development

This document describes day-to-day development and local build flow for this repository.

## CI Workflows

Build and release are matrix-driven via `build.yaml`.

- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: reusable matrix build + artifact merge
- `.github/workflows/build-all.yml`: build all targets from `build.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/build-inputs.yml`: build selected targets by `artifact-name`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: build all + publish firmware release assets

## Recommended Workflow (GitHub Actions)

1. Edit `config/*.keymap`, `config/*.conf`, `build.yaml`, or shield files.
2. Commit and push your branch.
3. Wait for CI (`Build All Firmware` or test workflows).
4. Download build artifacts from Actions or release assets from Releases.
5. Flash matching firmware files to target devices.

This keeps builds aligned with pinned dependencies in `config/west.yml`.

## Local Build (Docker, CI-like)

Two local services are provided in `docker-compose.yml`:

- `zmk-build-release`: uses `zmkfirmware/zmk-build-arm:stable` and your pinned `config/west.yml` revision.
- `zmk-build-main`: overrides only the `zmk` project revision to `main` via `--zmk-revision main`.

Note: Docker image tags (`stable`, `3.5`, etc.) define the build environment/toolchain, not the ZMK firmware revision itself.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (Docker Desktop or Docker Engine)
- Repository cloned locally

### Short, cross-platform command (recommended)

From repository root:

```bash
# List valid artifact-name values from build.yaml
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release --list

# Build selected targets
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release --artifact-names totem_left,totem_right,totem_reset

# Build with wildcard patterns (shell-style)
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release --artifact-names "totem_*"
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release --artifact-names "*_left,*_right"

# Build in parallel (up to 3 targets at a time)
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release --artifact-names "totem_*" --jobs 3

# Build every target in build.yaml
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-release

# Build against ZMK main (local override of zmk project revision)
docker compose run --rm zmk-build-main --artifact-names totem_left
```

Notes:

- This uses `docker-compose.yml` and `scripts/local.py`.
- Output artifacts are written to `firmware/`.
- Build directories are kept under `.build/local/build/`.
- West workspace/cache state is kept under `.build/local/workspace/` (release) and `.build/local/workspace-main/` (main).
- `--artifact-names` accepts exact names and wildcard patterns. If a pattern matches nothing, the script exits with an error.
- `--jobs` controls matrix-level parallelism.
- If `--jobs` is omitted, it auto-selects `min(selected entries, max(1, physical core count // 2))`.
- Even when `--jobs` is provided, the runner caps it to physical core count.

### Direct docker run (without compose)

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace zmkfirmware/zmk-build-arm:stable python3 scripts/local.py --artifact-names "totem_left,totem_right"

# Parallel example
docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w /workspace zmkfirmware/zmk-build-arm:stable python3 scripts/local.py --artifact-names "totem_*" --jobs 3
```

### Why not plain CMake?

Use `west build` instead of raw `cmake` for ZMK firmware. `west` handles:

- Zephyr/ZMK workspace initialization
- module resolution from `config/west.yml`
- snippet wiring and board/shield build conventions

The local runner follows the same model as the GitHub workflow and keeps command length short.

## Flashing

For each target device:

1. Connect via USB.
2. Enter bootloader mode (usually double-tap reset).
3. Copy the matching `.uf2` file to the mounted drive.
4. Wait for automatic reboot.

## Quick Troubleshooting

- Unknown `artifact-name`: run `--list` and use an exact name or valid wildcard from `build.yaml`.
- Missing module/build errors: rerun without `--skip-update` so `west update` runs.
- `recursive 'source' of 'Kconfig.zephyr' detected`: this usually means a local Zephyr checkout exists under repo `zephyr/`. The local runner now stages only git-visible module files, but cleanup of stale local checkouts still helps (`zephyr/`, `modules/`, `.west/`).
- No `.uf2` output for a target: check for fallback binary output (`.bin`), board type, and build logs.
- Split reconnect problems after flashing: flash reset firmware and re-pair.
